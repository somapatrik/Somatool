Android app able to read data from Siemens S7 PLC memory. You can also store PLCs in categories.

## Current app status
I have decided to make this a public repository. It seems that reading data directly from PLC is not the most used method anymore and so the impact of this application is not that great. This is mainly due to the wider use of PLCs that are newer than S7-300 line, which mostly use optimized data blocks.
